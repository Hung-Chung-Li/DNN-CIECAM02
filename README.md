# DNN-CIECAM02
A DNN-based model for CIECAM02 application

In the study, a DNN-based model for CIECAM02 application with the novel optimizer and activation functions are proposed. The predicted color appearance Jab from the DNN-based model well represents those attributes of CIECAM02 with high R-squared and acceptable RMSE values. The result also verifies that the color appearance model can be adequately described by typical neural networks architecture.
