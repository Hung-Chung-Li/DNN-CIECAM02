# DNN-CIECAM02
 A DNN-based model for CIECAM02 application

In the study, a DNN-based model for CIECAM02 application with the novel optimizer and activation functions are proposed. The predicted color appearance Jab from the DNN-based model well represents those attributes of CIECAM02 with high R-squared and acceptable RMSE values. The result also verifies that the color appearance model can be adequately described by typical neural networks architecture. 

The CIECAM02 color appearance model proposed by CIE Technical Committee 8-01 has been successfully used in cross-media color reproduction. It can predict both relative and absolute color appearance attributes such as Lightness and Brightness considering luminance adaptation, chromatic adaptation, cone response functions, simultaneous contrast, surround effect, discounting-the-illuminant, Stevens and Hunt effects.
